# 12_factor_app

Creating a FastAPI application that satisfies the 12 constraints of 12 factor app.

This is a simple weather application that uses free Weather API. The frontend is created in React JS with Vite, while the backend is in FastAPI. The simple purpose as already mentioned is to create a 12 factor application.

So, here's what the project does. First the user types in the name of the city for which s/he needs to check the weather. The backend then sends a request through the API which then returns the actual weather data. Then the React application receives the data and displays the necessary information to the user.
